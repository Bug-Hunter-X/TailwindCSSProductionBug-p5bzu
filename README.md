This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply in a production build, despite appearing correct in development. The bug.html file showcases the issue, while bugSolution.html provides a potential solution involving PurgeCSS configuration.  The core problem revolves around how PurgeCSS interacts with the build process to eliminate unused CSS, sometimes mistakenly removing necessary classes.
