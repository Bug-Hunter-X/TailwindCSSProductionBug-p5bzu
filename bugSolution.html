The problem was resolved by correctly configuring PurgeCSS to include all necessary templates or components where Tailwind CSS classes are used.  Ensure the paths to your template files in the PurgeCSS configuration accurately reflect your project structure.  After correctly configuring PurgeCSS, rebuild the project, and the Tailwind CSS classes should be correctly applied in the production build.  Review the updated `bugSolution.html` for the correct PurgeCSS configuration.
