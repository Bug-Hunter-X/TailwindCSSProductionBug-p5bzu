I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements, even though I had followed the setup instructions carefully.  My CSS appeared to be correctly imported, and the classes were syntactically valid according to the Tailwind documentation.  The issue only manifested in production, not during development.
